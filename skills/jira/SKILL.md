# Jira — ARC Full Reference

## MCP Prefix
Use `mcp__atlassian__` exclusively. Ignore `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__`.

## Core Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `getJiraIssue` | Fetch — always include `fields` param |
| `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` | JQL search |
| `editJiraIssue` | Edit — fetch first, never blind |
| `transitionJiraIssue` | Status change — use IDs below |
| `addCommentToJiraIssue` | Comment |
| `createJiraIssue` | Create (run metadata tools first) |
| `getTransitionsForJiraIssue` | Get transitions live (fallback when cached IDs fail) |

**Default fields:** `["summary","description","status","assignee","priority","parent","issuelinks","created","updated"]`

## Transitions — Simplified (User Story/Task/Sub-Task/Enhancement)
Global — any status → any status.
11=To Do · 21=In Progress · 31=Done · 81=In Test · 91=In Selloff · 101=Cancelled

## Transitions — Epic (same IDs as Simplified)
11=To Do · 21=In Progress · 31=Done · 81=In Test · 91=In Selloff · 101=Cancelled
Done/Cancelled conditional — may not appear if child issues are unresolved.

## Transitions — Defect/Sighting (state-specific)
From Open/Reopened: 4=Start Progress · 5=Resolve(screen) · 731/721=Request Info
From In Progress: 301=Stop Progress · 5=Resolve(screen) · 711=Request Info
From Resolved: 701=Close(screen) · 3=Reopen(screen)
From Closed: 3=Reopen(screen)
Cached 2026-03-17. On 404 error → call `getTransitionsForJiraIssue` live.

## JQL Defaults
```
project = ARC AND assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done
project = ARC AND issuetype = Defect AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY priority ASC
project = ARC AND issuetype = "User Story" AND sprint in openSprints()
parent = ARC-[N]
```
Note: Issue type is `"User Story"` (not `Story`) in ARC.

## Comment Format
Markdown input. ≤150 words. Sections + bullets > prose. No filler openers.
Match Jason's structured style with `## Heading` structure.

**Progress:** ## Status Update → Done / Active / Blocked / Next
**Defect:** ## Root Cause Analysis → Root Cause / Affected / Fix / Verify
**Sub-task done:** ## Completed → Branch + Commit (code fmt) / what / Notes
**Decision:** ## Decision → Decision + by whom / Context / Impact / Date

## Issue Summaries
- User Story: noun-phrase or action
- Defect: component — broke — impact
- Sub-Task: verb-first action

## PR Title
`ARC-### - Short outcome description` (≤60 chars after prefix, from branch name)
Sections: Closes · Problem · Solution · Files changed (4+) · How to verify

## Guardrails
- Fetch before any edit
- Append descriptions, never overwrite
- Existing labels only — never create new
- All JQL scoped to `project = ARC` by default
- Ticket numbers in commits/branches/PRs only (Rule 6)
- Sub-Task priority: leave as None (inherits from parent)
